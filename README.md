# TicTacToeMD
Tic Tac Toe Game For Sega Genesis/MegaDrive

This is my first attempt at a Sega MegaDrive game, and was basically done as a sandbox/learning excercise.

It took me a couple of days, using the excellent SGDK v1.80 https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK

Hopefully the source code may prove useful to someone looking to get started.

## I Just Want The Game
If you just want the ROM for the game (to play in an emulator or put on a flashcart), get the rom.bin file in the out directory.
